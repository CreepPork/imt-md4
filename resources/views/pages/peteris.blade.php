    <h2>Prepping</h2>

    <h3>Plan</h3>
    <p>First you'll want to understand what is applicable in your situation, what you want to achieve and what's
        available in your country, check your local electronics stores</p>
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/6c/db/cc6cdb8a7b92ce11e4ae22e7623d9498.jpg">

    <h3>Mount your monitor arms to the desk</h3>
    <p>There are two types of monitor arms, the ones you attach to the side of the desk and the ones which you have to
        drill through the desk, either way you should start with checking where they fit on your desk</p>
    <img

    <h3>VESA Mounting</h3>
    <p>Screw your monitor to the VESA mount of the monitor arm</p>

    <h3>Align the monitors</h3>
    <p>Align the monitors in an angle that is facing you, depending on your monitors viewing angles it might be easier
        to do or harder on the eyes if done incorrectly, another thing to take in mind is whether you want to mount a
        monitor vertically or horizontally</p>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vIJAdMoxCc4/maxresdefault.jpg">

    <h3>Align the monitors in your OS(Optional for multi monitor setup)</h3>
    <p>If you aligned all your monitors horizontally and have an Nvidia GPU, you can use Nvidia surround to make this
        step easier, if not and you are a windows user, you can open settings -> System -> Display and 'Select and
        rearrange displays' to align your monitors</p>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2B8kJZGftuaATk7QAdp4dU-970-80.jpg">

    <h3>RGB LED Strips</h3>
    <p>Glue some LED Strips on the back of your monitor to make a backlight that makes working in the dark easier on the
        eyes and give your setup a personalised touch, by turing them on in your fauvorite colour, bonus points on the
        cable management if your strips work with power from USB and your monitors have a free USB port</p>
